    "### 1) Overview\n",
    "- Perceptron is a Single Layered Neural Network.\n",
    "- It is a Binary Classifier \n",
    "    - The  output is binary : e.g. true/false, 0 or 1, pass or fail, etc\n",
    "    - Can have any number of inputs\n",
    "    - Example:-\n",
    "    <table>\n",

    "- ***Weights***\n",
    "    - Each connection between the input(s) neurons has an associated weight (w1,w2, w3...)\n",
    "    - A Positive Weight increases the influence of an input.\n",
    "    - A Negative Weight decreases or inversely affects the input.\n",
    "    - Weights are initially ***initialized randomly***.\n",
    "- ***Bias***\n",
    "    - If the weights when initialized are randomly initialized to 0, W1X1 = 0 (in Step 1), where W1 = weight 1, X1 = Input 1\n",
    "    - To avoid from this happening we add a Bias with some initial value so that the whole neuron's value is not 0 (0 = deactivated)\n",
    "    - The Bias is typically Noise. \n",
    "    - Noise basically means that data is totally different from the rest of the data - But our model should be capable enough to handle that as well.\n",
    "- ***Perceptron is a Linear classifier***\n",
    "    -  Step 1's equation (below) is exactly similar to the Equation of a Line.\n",
    "    - This means that Perceptron is a Linear Classifier\n",
