    "**Data Encoding**\n",
    "Data Encoding means converting a set of Categorical values into Numeral values for a specific purpose in Machine Learning.\n",
    "e.g. Assume you have the following-\n",
    "\n",
    "Experience  Degree                      Salary\n",
    "(input)     (input)                     (output)\n",
    "            (categorical variable)\n",
    "8 years     BE\n",
    "            PHD\n",
    "            Masters\n",
    "Based on the input variables we have to predict the output variable - Salary.\n",
    "The Machine Learning algorithm will have a hard time understanding the Categorical variables for Degree - BE, PHD, etc.\n",
    "e.g. BE = (1,0,0), PHD = (0,1,0), Masters = (0,0,1)\n",
    "So we convert these Categorical variables into Numeral Variables. This is known as Encoding            \n",
    "\n",
    "**Sparse Matrix**\n",
    "- A matrix with 1's and 0's is known as Sparse Matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Over Fitting**\n",
    "When a machine learning model learns too well on training data - including noise, mistakes, random fluctuations so it often memorizes instead of learning patterns, so it performs very well on training data but poorly on new/unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fit and Transform**\n",
    "- In Machine Learning 'fit' and 'transform' are two key steps used in data pre-processing (esp with skikit-learn)\n",
    "- fit = Learn the rules from data*\n",
    "    - The transfomer learns some values from your dataset.\n",
    "    - e.g. mean, median, mode, standard deviation, unique categories, what values are missing\n",
    "- transform will apply the rules learnt from 'fit' to the data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Types of Encodings**\n",
    "**1) One Hot Encoding(OHE) / Normal Encoding**\n",
    "- One Hot Encoding is also known as Nominal Encoding\n",
    "- It is a technique used to represent categorical data as numerical data, which is more suitable for machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "- In this technique, each category is represented as a binary vector where each bit corresponds to a unique category.\n",
    "- For Example\n",
    "Red     Green       Blue    Encoded value       Color\n",
    "  1        0          0        1,0,0              Red\n",
    "  0        1          0        0,1,0              Green\n",
    "  0        0          1        0,0,1              Blue\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages of One Hot Encoding / Nominal Encoding**\n",
    "1) If one of the Categorical values has 100 different types of categories, then this algorithm will create 100 different types of encodings.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Overfitting\n",
    "When you have a Sparse Matrix usage (as in the case of OHE), then it leads to Overfitting, which is not good.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**2) Label Encoding**\n",
    "- Label encoding and ordinal encoding are two techniques used to encode categorical data as numerical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Labek encoding involves assigning a unique numerical label to each category in the variable. \n",
    "- The labels are usually assigned in alphabetical order OR based on the frequence of the categories.\n",
    "- E.g. If we have a categorical variable 'color' with three possible values (red, green, blue) we can represent it using 'Label encoding' as follows:-\n",
    "1) Red 1\n",
    "2) Green 2\n",
    "3) Blue 3\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages of Label Encoding**\n",
    " - In Label Encoding, if the categories Red, Green, Blue are assigned encodings 1,2,3 respectively, then the ML model might think that 3 is greater than 2, and 2 is greater than 1.\n",
    " - In such a case it might prefer or rank Blue Higher than Red, but in our case all categories are equal.\n",
    " - THis problem is solved using Ordinal Encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**3) Ordinal Encoding**\n",
    "- Ordinal Encoding is used to encode categorial cata that have an intrinsic order or ranking.\n",
    "- In this technique, each category is assigned a numerical value based on its position in the order.\n",
    "- E.g. IF we have a categorical variable 'education level', with four possible values (high schoo, college, graduate, post-graduate), we can represent it using ordinal encoding as follows:\n",
    "1) High School : 1\n",
    "2) College: 2\n",
    "3) Graduate: 3\n",
    "4) Post-graduate: 4\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Rankings given by us like so:-\n",
    "**Assgning ranking to the sizes**\n",
    "encoder = OrdinalEncoder(categories=[['small', 'medium', 'large']])\n",
    "\n",
    "**4) Target Guided Ordinal Encoding**\n",
    "- It is a technique that is used to encode a 'categorical variable' based on their relationship with another variable known as the 'target variable'.\n",
    "- This encoding technique is useful when we have a categorical variable with a large number of unique categories and we want to use this variable as a feature in our machine learning model.\n",
    "- In Target Guided Ordinal Encoding we replace each category in the categorical variable with a numerical value based on the mean or median of the target variable for that category.\n",
    "- This creates a relationship between the categorical variable and the target variable which can improve the predecive power of our model."
