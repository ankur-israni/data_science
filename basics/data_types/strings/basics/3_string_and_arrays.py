'''
Like many other popular programming languages, strings in Python are arrays of bytes representing unicode characters.

However, Python does not have a character data type, a single character is simply a string with a length of 1.

Square brackets can be used to access elements of the string.
'''
str = "Hello, World!"
print(str[1])


print(str[0])       # Prints first character of the string
print(str[2:5])     # Prints characters starting from 3rd to 5th
print(str[2:])      # Prints string starting from 3rd character
print(str * 2)      # Prints string two times
